# ARKNIGHTS!!!

Hello!!! I go by the name of **K**uro or **N**ue! But you can also call me **A**me! I'm a very friendly person and tend to be quite shy around strangers. But, when we actually start talking, you'll see how chatty I can be! Please, let me know what you're comfortable and not comfortable with when we interact! So I can avoid making you uncomfy. It's very important(at least, to me) to make sure you're having a nice experience with me. Sometimes, i'll be around goiing full hyper or just messing around with some friends, but I'm mostly quiet overall.

I'm really anxious & nervous when it comes to certain topics, If I do not reply or remain quiet, please take the hint. Don't drag drama to me or to any of my friends, that's the last thing we want to deal with. Feel free to cuddle or hide, **as long you're not a weirdo.**
