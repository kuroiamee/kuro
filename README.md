# ೃ⁀➷ _Kuro_ ~ _Ame_

⍣ ೋ *Hello, you can call me _Kuro_ or _Nue_!!! I'm a very friendly person who is quite shy at first, but I'll slowly getting a little chatty as the time passes. This is a brief introduction so... I like _Hololive_ and _Aether Gazer_, and I _hate_ loud noises and dramas, so, please, keep that in mind </3*

I'm really anxious & nervous when it comes to certain topics, If I do not reply or remain quiet, please take the hint. Don't drag drama to me or to any of my friends, that's the last thing we want to deal with. I don't mind cuddles or hide, so, you're always free to come and sit with me, if you wish(**If I'm with friends, please, do ask them first.**)
